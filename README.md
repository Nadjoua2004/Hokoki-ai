# **Hokoki AI - React Native App**  

Welcome to the **Hokoki AI** project! This README will guide you through setting up the project, collaborating effectively, and contributing to our AI-powered mobile app.  

## **Project Overview**  
Hokoki AI is a **React Native** application built using **Expo**. Our goal is to develop an intelligent mobile app collaboratively while keeping the codebase clean and well-organized.  

## **Figma Design Link**  
üîó **Figma Link:** [https://www.figma.com/design/DY1PSRIr8HoeWThbz3PPX3/Hokoki-AI-app?node-id=2008-10&t=jJ7NFySwbU3D4IjW-1]  

## **Getting Started**  

### **1. Prerequisites**  
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:  

- **Node.js** (v18 or above)  
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)  
- **Expo CLI**  

To check if they are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:  

```bash
node -v
npm -v
expo --version
```  

If **Expo CLI** is not installed, install it using:  

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```  

### **2. Clone the Repository**  
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to save the project.  

Clone the repository:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/HokokiAi.git
```  

Navigate to the project directory:  

```bash
cd HokokiAi
```  

### **3. Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:  

```bash
npm install
```  

### **4. Launch the Development Server**  
Start the Expo development server:  

```bash
expo start
```  

After running the command, a QR code will appear in the terminal. Scan it using the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device, or run the app in an emulator.

## **Collaboration Workflow**  
To collaborate on this project, follow these steps:  

### **Step 1: Create a Feature Branch**  
Before making changes, always create a new branch for the feature or bug fix you're working on:  

First, pull the latest changes from the master branch:  

```bash
git pull origin master
```  

Create a new branch for your feature:  

```bash
git checkout -b feature-<feature-name>
```  

(Replace `<feature-name>` with a descriptive name, e.g., `feature-login-ui`.)  

### **Step 2: Work on Your Feature**  
Make changes in your local environment and test your code thoroughly. Regularly commit your changes with meaningful messages:  

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add <description-of-change>"
```  

(Example: `"Add login screen UI"`)  

### **Step 3: Push Your Feature Branch**  
Push your branch to GitHub:  

```bash
git push origin feature-<feature-name>
```  

### **Step 4: Create a Pull Request**  
1. Go to **GitHub** ‚Üí **Pull Requests**.  
2. Click on **"New Pull Request"**.  
3. Set the base branch to `master` and compare it with your feature branch.  
4. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.  
5. Add a description explaining your changes and submit the PR.  

### **Step 5: Address Feedback**  
If there‚Äôs feedback on your pull request:  
- Make the requested changes on your local branch.  
- Push the updates:  

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update based on feedback"
git push origin feature-<feature-name>
```  

Your pull request will automatically update with the new commits.

üö® Important Notes to Prevent Conflicts
To ensure smooth collaboration and avoid unnecessary issues, please follow these guidelines:

‚ùå Do NOT install random packages ‚Äì Only install dependencies after discussing them with the team.

‚ùå Do NOT modify configuration files ‚Äì Files like package.json, app.json, babel.config.js, etc., should not be changed unless necessary and approved by the team.

‚ùå Do NOT modify App.js ‚Äì This file is used as the main entry point. If changes are needed, discuss them first to prevent conflicts.

‚úÖ Always work in a separate branch ‚Äì Never push directly to main.

‚úÖ Communicate with the team ‚Äì If you're making major changes, let everyone know in the group chat or project discussion.

## **Additional Notes**  
- Always **pull the latest changes** before starting new work.  
- Use **meaningful commit messages** for better tracking.  
- Follow the **code style guidelines** to keep the code clean and readable.


Happy coding! üöÄüéâ
